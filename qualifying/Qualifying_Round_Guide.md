- Use expression tag to decode

#### Challenge 2: Script Sorcerer's Test (15 min)
"Fix this broken script that should calculate production efficiency"
```python
def calculate_efficiency(goodParts, totalParts):
    # Script has 3 intentional errors
    efficiency = goodParts / totalPart * 100
    if efficiency > 100
        return 100
    return round(efficency, 2)
```

#### Challenge 3: Vision Quest (20 min)
"Create a popup that shows real-time data from 3 different sources"
